# Forecasting-carbon-dioxide-Emissions-levels-in-Jordan
Year after year the percentage of carbon dioxide emissions in Jordan increase dramatically, and this lead to increase the temperature , to investigate this, the project aims to study the impact of CO2 emissions in on temperature and then use deep learning algorithm to predict the CO2 emission level through the next 10 years
