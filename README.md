# Forecasting-carbon-dioxide-Emissions-levels-in-Jordan
Year after year the percentage of carbon dioxide emissions in Jordan increase dramatically, and this lead to increase the temperature , to investigate this, the project aims to study the impact of CO2 emissions in on temperature and then use deep learning algorithm to predict the CO2 emission level through the next 10 years.

# What is happening? 
Global average temperatures have increased by more than 1 °C since pre-industrial times.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the single most important climate-relevant greenhouse gas in Earth’s atmosphere. 

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  is already experiencing the impacts of a changing climate and the city's administration is now acting to reduce the emission from its 0.07% share of global GHG emissions.

# Problem Definition
Analyzing the increase in the average  temperature based on the increasing amount of CO2 emissions.

Evaluating the goverment progress of reducing CO2 emissions with the regulation applied upon the sectors contributing to it.
